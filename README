NAME
    Locale::TextDomain::UTF8 - Shortcut to use Locale::TextDomain and
    decoding to UTF8

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Instead of:

     use Locale::TextDomain 'Some-TextDomain';

    you now say:

     use Locale::TextDomain::UTF8 'Some-TextDomain';

DESCRIPTION
     use Locale::TextDomain::UTF8 'Some-TextDomain'

    is equivalent to:

     use Locale::TextDomain 'Some-TextDomain';
     use Locale::Messages qw(bind_textdomain_filter);
     use Encode;
     BEGIN {
         $ENV{OUTPUT_CHARSET} = 'UTF-8';
         bind_textdomain_filter 'Some-TextDomain' => \&Encode::decode_utf8;
     }

    it's just more convenient, especially if you have to do it for each
    textdomain.

    Why would you want this? To ensure that strings returned by the "__()",
    et al functions are UTF8-encoded Perl strings. For example, if you want
    to pass the strings to Unicode::GCString. For more details, see the Perl
    Advent article mentioned in the SEE ALSO section.
